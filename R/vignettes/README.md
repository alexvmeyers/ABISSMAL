<h2>Overview</h2>

The goal of these tutorials is to disseminate basic R coding skills in a biological context through the ABISSMAL behavioral tracking system. I want to have 6 short tutorials in English and Spanish. I want an Rmd file per tutorial in each language, plus an accompanying video of the screen as I work through each one (ideally I'll have a script of what I'll say per video too).

1. Introduction to RStudio, download ABISSMAL GitHub repository, introduction to the ABISSMAL data processing / analysis workflow

2. Setup a virtual workspace (global environment, package installation, working directory, RMarkdown files)

3. Create simulated data, including entrances, exits, and perching events

4. Save data and practice writing loops

5. Combine the raw data, detect perching events and pre-process the raw data, make simple barcode plots of the raw and per-processed data, and highlight how to encode color in these plots

6. For vignette 06, I want to detect clusters, score clusters, generate summary statistics, and make a complex barcode style visuals


To do:

- Update file descriptions in README

- Make a pre- and post-vignette Google form to asses the content and style of the vignettes for disseminating basic R coding skills in a biological context

- Translate text/comments in each vignette to Spanish
