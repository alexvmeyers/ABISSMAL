<h2>Overview</h2>

The goal of these tutorials is to disseminate basic R coding skills in a biological context through the ABISSMAL behavioral tracking system. I want to have 5 short tutorials in English and Spanish. I want an Rmd file per tutorial in each language, plus an accompanying video of the screen as I work through each one (ideally I'll have a script of what I'll say per video too).

1. Introduction to RStudio, download ABISSMAL GitHub repository, introduction to the ABISSMAL data processing / analysis workflow

2. Create simulated data and working directories

3. Combine the raw data, detect perching events and pre-process the raw data

4. Detect clusters, score clusters

5. Run steps 2-4 with simulated data from 3 experimental replicates

6. Make a visualization with results from the 3 simulated replicates

Note that code for processing and analzying biological data collected from zebra finches, and code to make figures, is published online as part of a submitted manuscript for the ABISSMAL tracking system.
