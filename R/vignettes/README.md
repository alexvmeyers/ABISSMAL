<h2>Overview</h2>

The goal of these tutorials is to disseminate basic R coding skills in a biological context through the ABISSMAL behavioral tracking system. I want to have 5 short tutorials in English and Spanish. I want an Rmd file per tutorial in each language, plus an accompanying video of the screen as I work through each one (ideally I'll have a script of what I'll say per video too).

1. Introduction to RStudio, download ABISSMAL GitHub repository, introduction to the ABISSMAL data processing / analysis workflow

2. Setup a virtual workspace (global environment, package installation, working directory, RMarkdown files)

3. Create simulated data, including entrances, exits, and perching events

4. Combine the raw data and pre-process the raw data, detect perching events

5. Make barcode style visualizations of the raw and per-processed data

6. Detect clusters, score clusters, generate summary statistics

Note that code for processing and analyzing biological data collected from zebra finches, and code to make figures, is published online as part of a submitted manuscript for the ABISSMAL tracking system.

Also note that the knitted output for these tutorials must be visible from the ABISSMAL website. This is especially important for accessibility of the Introduction for people who haven't downloaded the ABISSMAL repo yet
