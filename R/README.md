Need to add information about the hardware setup that these functions were written for

One beam breaker pair sits in front of an RFID antenna (outside of the container, the "outer" pair), and the other sits behind the RFID antenna (mounted for detections inside of the container, the "inner" pair). The camera records into the center of the nest container from above. 


Then a description of each function
Possibly add a function to see how much of the original detections were dropped / retained after each pre-processing and integration step?
